A hugely undervalued skill is the art of subtraction.
While most companies and their managers are focussed on adding features, only a few understand that in order to keep a product or service healthy, you will need to remove things as well.
Delete any feature, part or process that you can.
You will probably have to add some of them back later, this is perfectly fine.
If you do not end up adding back some things, you probably didnâ€™t delete enough.
You cannot know where the line is if you never cross it.
