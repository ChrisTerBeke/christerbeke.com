When working in growing companies, you'll start to notice that the amount of requirements grows as well.
Often these requirements are fuzzy and it is unclear who wrote them in the first place.
Before you know it your product has all kinds complexity from requirements that weren't neccesery in the first place.
How to fix this?

**Question every requirement**

When discussing existing or incoming requirements, decide first if the requirement makes sense at all.
Questions you can ask to determine this include:

- Does it align with common sense?
- Does it add user value to your product or service?
- Does it conflict with other requirements?

**Every requirement needs a name**

A big problem with requirements is that they start to live their own life in an organization.
After several years it is no longer clear where the requirement came from.
To prevent this, put the name of a person behind every requirement.
Not a department, a team or a role, but a specific person.
When a requirement is challenged, you should go to this person and have an in-depth discussion with them.
This person is responsible and accountable for the existance of the requirement, including it's end-of-life.

**Minimize the amount of non-functional requirements**

Over time, the amount of requirements that are non-functional (not targreting end-users of the product or service) grows.
These are often covering topics like security, standards, design systems, system architecture, and vendor management.
While these can be great enablers, they can also reduce a team's independence and ability to move fast.
A better way would be to treat these as recommendations rather than requirements.
If a team sees another tool or way-of-working that fits better with their culture and product, they should be allowed to use it.
