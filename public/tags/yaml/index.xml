      <description>This post is the second in a series of three about supercharging your Terraform setup using YAML.&#xA;In part one of this series we learned how to use YAML to simplify the configuration of Terraform resources. We mainly focussed on reducing syntax overhead of the HCL language and making the configuration accessible to non-infra engineers.&#xA;In this second part we will dive into some more advanced techniques and patterns.</description>

However it&amp;rsquo;s using a custom language called HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language). In this blog post we will explore how we can replace as much HCL code as possible with YAML and what the benefits are of doing so.</description>
